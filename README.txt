This code is to predict the movement of a randomly moving python turtle. Its pretty basic, I know. But its something that I did as an intro into basic prediction algorithims.

Any code / algorithims / equations are 100% mine (I hope). Feel free to make any changes or improvements to the code.

Ty :D
